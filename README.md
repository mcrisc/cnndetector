# CNN-detector

This is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) we implemented to participate in the shared task 
*Discriminating between Similar Languages* (DSL) that was organized as part of 
the [VarDial workshop](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-1201.pdf) at EACL'17.

Our experiments are described in the paper 
[Discriminating between Similar Languages with Word-level Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-1215.pdf).


## Dataset

This model was trained and evaluated on the DSL Corpus Collection (DSLCC) v4.0, which is available at: http://ttg.uni-saarland.de/resources/DSLCC/
